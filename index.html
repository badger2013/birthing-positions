    <h1>Birthing Positions</h1>

    <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;font-size: large;">
        "However much we know about birth in general, we know nothing about a particular birth. We must let it unfold
        with its own uniqueness." - Elizabeth Noble
    </p>

    <p>
        Historically giving birth in an upright position was the norm. However in recent years laying down or propped up
        in a semi-recumbent position has been adopted out of convenience for the attending physician. An increasing
        number of studies indicate this is not an optimal birthing position.
    </p>

    <p>Freedom of movement is essential to achieve a normal physiologic birth.<sup>14</sup> In fact, upright birthing
        positions are
        optimal for humans (and all mammals with this fetal head to pelvic outlet ratio).<sup>7</sup> There are many
        benefits of
        frequent position changes during labor and a self-selected upright birthing position. These benefits include:
        <sup>1,3,6,7,8,16,17,20</sup>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>shorter second stage of labour</li>
        <li>more effective uterine muscle contractions</li>
        <li>reduction in back pain</li>
        <li>supports fetal oxygenation</li>
        <li>reduces abnormal fetal heart tones</li>
        <li>facilitates rotation of baby through the birth canal</li>
        <li>promotes gentle soft tissue yield, minimizing perineal trauma</li>
        <li>preserves birthing person's energy</li>
        <li>emotionally empowering</li>
        <li>lowers rates of interventions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Upright birth positions are beneficial for breech presentation too. Research indicates upright vaginal breech
        deliveries result in shorter second stage labor, fewer maneuvers, fewer injuries to the birth person and baby,
        and fewer cesareans compared to the dorsal or lying down position.<sup>9,15</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        People who give birth in upright positions tend to report higher childbirth satisfaction and often report
        feeling powerful, protected, and self-confident.<sup>13,19</sup> Upright birth positions are connected with the
        pregnant
        person playing an active role in the decision making process during labor and delivery and are often reported as
        their preferred birthing position.<sup>19</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">What are upright birthing positions?</span> These positions include squatting,
        sitting, standing, kneeling, and
        quadraped (on hands and knees). There are many variations of all of these positions. What they all have in
        common is allowing for gravity assistance and for the bony joints of the pelvis to shift and move to allow for
        the baby’s descent.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the pelvis is unrestricted, as in upright birthing positions, each joint of the pelvis moves in a
        multiplanar direction.
        <br />
        At the pelvic inlet:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sacrum extends</li>
        <li>Ilial outflares and ischium inflares</li>
        <li>Superior portion of sacroiliac joint and pubic symphysis expands</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Lumbar extension (arching back), hip abduction (moving thigh away from midline), and hip external rotation (toes
        pointed out) supports these pelvic movements to maximize the pelvic inlet space.<sup>11</sup>
        <br />
        At the pelvic outlet:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sacrum flexes</li>
        <li>Ilial inflares and ischium outflares</li>
        <li>Inferior portion of sacroiliac joint and pubic symphysis expands</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Lumbar flexion (curving back), hip adduction (moving thigh towards midline), hip internal rotation (toes pointed
        in) supports these pelvic movements to maximize the pelvic outlet space.<sup>11</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        There is likely not one specific optimal upright birthing position as each birth is unique in its own asymmetry.
        However there are some general defining characteristics of an optimal birth position:<sup>11</sup>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Frequent position changes as labor progresses </li>
        <li>Pelvic bones and sacrum are not fixed and free to move</li>
        <li>Gravitational influence is considered (gravity assisted vs gravity neutral)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gravity assisted</span>: upright birthing positions such as squatting
                and on hands and knees
            </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gravity neutral</span>: sidelying or lying back in a semi-recumbent
                position </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Squatting</span>: This is great as it allows for both sacral and pelvic
        mobility. This allows for optimal shifting of
        the pelvic bones to maximize opening at the pelvic inlet and outlets. Gravity assists in this position which
        allows for more efficient uterine muscle contractions. Squatting does put the most pressure on the perineum.
        There is conflicting evidence on whether or not this increases the risk of perineal tearing.<sup>4,5,12</sup>
        Squatting
        with support, however, allows for the pelvic floor muscles to relax more easily. It’s important that the low
        back is supported and not the sacrum so that the sacrum is still free to move. Research has shown squatting
        reduces back pain, supports fetal oxygenation, facilitates rotation of the baby through the birth
        canal.<sup>7</sup>
        Squatting also shortens the second stage of labor and less pain overall is reported.<sup>10</sup>

    </div>

    <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Forward Leaning</span>: This is great as it allows sacral mobility. It also
        allows for optimal shifting of the pelvic
        bones to maximize opening at the pelvic inlet and outlets. There is some assistance from gravity but not so much
        that it increases pressure on the perineum. The risk of perineal tearing in these positions are low. Research
        has shown forward leaning reduces back pain, encourages fetal head flexion, and encourages rotation of a baby in
        occiput posterior (back to back) position.<sup>7</sup>

                positions
                compared to being in bed resulting in more
                effective contractions.<sup>18</sup> Giving birth in water decreases risk of perineal tearing by
                allowing
                for
                more gentle
                soft tissue yield.<sup>2</sup> It also decreases the risk of postpartum hemorrhaging.<sup>2</sup>

    </div>

    <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Side-lying</span>: This position does allow for sacral mobility. It can be an
        organizing and calming position for the
        birthing person, as well as, a good resting position if the birthing person is fatigued. It’s a gravity neutral
        position so it provides protection from perineal tearing.
        The downside is that only the top pelvis bone is free to shift and move as the baby descends. The bottom pelvis
        bone is fixed which can limit the amount of opening able to be achieved through the pelvic inlet and outlet. Due
        to this asymmetry, a long time spent in this position can increase the likelihood of pelvic dysfunction
        postpartum which can be corrected with pelvic floor physical therapy or chiropractic care.

    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Semi-recumbent</span>: It’s a gravity neutral position. Although due to the
                shape of the sacrum one could argue it's
                against gravity. Since the sacrum is fixed and can’t move in this position, the alignment of the sacrum
                causes
                the birthing person to push uphill to some degree and is more energy taxing for the birthing person.

    <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">During your postpartum time</span>: Tell your pelvic floor physical therapist
        the positions you were in during labor
        and birth. This will help them understand any concerns you have with mobility, back pain, pelvic pain, pain with
        intercourse, and bowel and bladder changes that may arise in the postpartum time.
    </p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">
        Most importantly, listen to your body and your baby. Only you, the birthing person, will know the optimal
        position to be in throughout your labor and birth. You got this!
